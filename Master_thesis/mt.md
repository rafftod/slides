<!-- header: Introduction -->

#### Objectives

-   Design and implement an architecture for swarm robotics development, in order to :
    -   Run virtual experiments with multiple RVRs and design control software within a simulation environment (ARGoS)
    -   Transpose the control software to real robot transparently
    -   Build a modular platform, both on the hardware and software sides
-   Evaluate the quality of existing swarm robotics techniques with this platform, notably automatic

#### Hardware architecture

-   Differential treaded robot with a large sensor set :

    -   Ground color sensor
    -   IMU (Accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope)
    -   Ambient light
    -   Locator (odometry)

-   Extended with proximity sensors and a lidar

#### Hardware architecture

#### Software architecture

-   Communication between the robot and the Raspberry Pi is ensured via serial and a dedicated Python API
-   Control software, with the ARGoS simulator, is implemented in C++
-   These two are bridged with ROS, the Robot Operating System

---

#### The Robot Operating System (ROS)

-   ROS is a framework for creating a software infrastructure for robots
-   It works similarly to an RSS feed :

    -   The information is communicated through _topics_
    -   Information sources _publish_ information on topics, which can then be read by _subscribers_
    -   Each component (subscriber or publisher) is a _node_

-   ROS enables communication between the robot API and the control software

#### Additional components

-   External sensors are running their own node, requiring no additional work for their integration

-   A color labeling node has been implemented to identify color labels more reliably

<!-- header: Simulation -->

#### Simulation

-   Simulation is a key part of the development process, to allow offline design, repeatability, reproducibility and testing
-   The simulation is implemented in ARGoS, a physics-based simulation environment designed for swarm robotics applications
-   A 3D model of the robot has been designed

#### Simulating sensors

-   Each of the robot's sensors is simulated in ARGoS
-   The noise of the sensors is evaluated with the real robot and generated similarly in the simulation
-   I will only go over the sensors that were in use for this thesis experiments
